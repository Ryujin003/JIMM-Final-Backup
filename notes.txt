Social media or forum since they better represent what we have learned in class.

Social media: user profile(settings in it), upload photo/post, live feed, search bar, filtering, discover page with different types
Theme: Animals
Gimmick: Add links to post that go to the things pictured in the post, have account recovery when loginign in (suggested by the TA)
Concept: Pet centric social media

Alternative ideas:
    - Forum: Summer project (Phineas and Ferb)
    - Forum: Cooking recipes (for college students)
    - Gimmick: Adding a quesiton of the week and you pick a side for the week. Compare likes so theres a winning side
        - this is just normal social media with controversy baked into it for fun teehee
